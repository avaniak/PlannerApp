# My Wedding Planner

## A personal assistant to plan your dream wedding 


**My Wedding Planner** is a desktop application which will be a personal assistant to plan a couples dream wedding. 
While planning a wedding one of the biggest hassles & time-consuming tasks is to find vendors, look at their portfolios 
and then book initial chats with them. This app aims to make this process easier by providing a one-stop-shop platform 
for couples to research and book consultations with various different wedding vendors. 

Once a customer goes on to the platform, they can search for an intended vendor (ex: Decor) and then view the selection 
of Decor companies on the platform. Once they click on the vendor, they can view their portfolios (via Instagram) and 
then book consultations with the top vendors of their choice. The app could also be made more efficient by adding the 
capability for the user to view the vendor calendar to check whether they are accepting bookings on the day of the 
event. In the future, the app can have an added functionality which allows the user to create a profile and track their
progress as well as favoured vendors to successfully plan the whole wedding on the platform. Having a user profile 
could also help with creating customized timelines for the day of the event which will be automatically sent to the 
vendors that have been booked through the app. 

For Phase 1 of my project, I wanted to implement an admin view console where: 
- As an admin, I am able to create a new Vendor List 
- As an admin, I am able to update the newly created Vendor List with one or more vendor names
- As an admin, I am able to retrieve and read the vendor list 
- As an admin, I am able to delete a vendor name from the Vendor List 

This project is of interest to me because I have worked as a wedding planner for 3 years and closely observed the 
industry. This is a pain point for majority of the weddings due to the saturation of various event-vendors these days. 
Given the customization and tailoring that each couple or family requires for their big day, having an (tech) assistant 
that takes care of these details could make the whole planning process more efficient.
